        <h2>Lalo</h2>
        <p id="lalo">
            Culturally, in the Artibonite department, Lalo is served in every important event; from wedding celebrations to commemorating someone's death. When having visitors, the Artibonitian will certainly cook it for their host. Even if it can be eaten every day, it is the main dish served in the votive festival of the region. Additionally, it is always served at any type of annual fair all over the country.

            The art of making Haitian Lalo is passed down from generation to generation. In the past, in the rural area of Artibonite, people from the same family lived together in what we call "Lakou". A Lakou is a large, delimited surface where family members built houses when they married. Consequently, all the kids would grow up together and learn by watching their moms, grandmothers, and aunts cook and by engaging as clerks. Usually, by the age of 11, most kids would master the art of cooking Lalo. In between, we also developed some other skills like how to handle a knife and prepare the Haitian famous spice "epis" that we use to marinate meat and season everything we cook, including the Lalo. Furthermore, we learned how to control the level of fire and temperature since we only used firewood or charcoal in the past. All that knowledge contributed to us becoming outstanding in the kitchen and being able to achieve a mouthwatering plate of Lalo and rice.

        <h2>Fritay</h2>
        <p id="fritay">
            The “Fritay” is a cultural food from my country, that my family raised from. The Fritay is made of green plantain, pork, grated malanga, garlic, scallions, pepper, and griot which is fried pork. The culture of the food come from West Africa since Haiti ancient histories. This food means so much to me because when I eat it I think about what our slaves was going through when they were cooking the food for others but they could not eat it and they were starving. Another thing that made me fall in love with this food is my mother because growing in our household this food had a lot of traditions because Haitians cook it almost on every occasions, and it bring a lot of childhood memories into me every time someone is eating or my mother is cooking it at home. When I was a child, I had a hard times at school I had trouble with other kids, so my mother cooked this food for me because she knew that it will make me feel better and convince me from being a trouble kid and stressing. What I like on Fritay is the spicy part of it which called pikliz in Haitian Creole.

        <h2>Giraumon Soap</h2>
        <p id="giraumon">
            The Haitian New Year's Day tradition  of soup joumou  or pumpkin soup is said to date back to January 1, 1804, the day Haitian slave and revolutionary leader Jean-Jacques Dessalines declared Haiti’s independence from its French colonizers.

            "This is a part of our culture," said Dubriede as she placed three turnips in a plastic bag. "No matter where Haitians are on January 1st we drink this soup."
            
            The story goes that Haitian slaves were forbidden from drinking soup joumou.  It was a delicacy reserved for their white masters. To celebrate Haiti's liberation, the soup became a symbol for freedom. 
            
             “When I’m drinking the soup, I feel like the soup is a legacy our ancestors left for us to remind us why we are free," said Dudley Alexis,  a Haitian-born Miami filmmaker.
            
            Alexis produced a documentary about the New Year tradition called “Liberty In A Soup.” He said every spoonful of soup is a reminder of the Haitian Revolution, a 12-year resistance by slaves that established the world's first black republic." 
            
             "The Haitian revolution pretty much echoed across the world reminding people that everyone is supposed to be free,”

        <h2>Legumes</h2>
        <p id="legumes">
            Legim or Haitian vegetable is a traditional Haitian dish in the form of a stew. It is composed of simmered beef and a very wide variety of vegetables. It can also contain fish instead of meat or even be simply prepared with vegetables for a vegetarian version.
            It is generally eaten with white rice or diri kolé rice and beans also called stuck rice. The large quantity of varied vegetables it contains makes this stew excellent for health, light and rather economical.

         It makes it easy to feed the whole family. Even though the preparation may seem a little long, the simmering time of the stew is the most important, you just need to check the cooking from time to time.
        In the Creole language, the term legim is associated with a wide variety of vegetables cooked together. The different varieties used must match and the preparation must be rich in flavors. Haitians love stews in general. This is very fragrant and can vary throughout the seasons using the different vegetables available

        Griot ( Haitian Creole  : griyo ) is a dish of Haitian cuisine . It consists of pork shoulder marinated in citrus fruits , braised and then fried . It is commonly served at parties 1 . Griot, along with diri ak pwa wouj (red beans and rice), is considered by some to be the “  national dish  ” of Haiti 
        Griot is usually prepared from a pork shoulder . The meat is first washed in a citrus juice mixture and then rinsed. Meat must always be washed; acidic oranges or limes are used instead of water because drinking water is often difficult to access 4 . After being washed, the meat is marinated in epis , which is a mixture of Haitian herbs , vegetables and spices. Then the meat is either braised or roasted until tender. The cooking liquid produced is used in the preparation of an accompanying sauce, called sòs ti-malis 5 . Finally, the meat is fried until golden and crispy. Griot is almost always served with pikliz as well as rice or bannann peze .
